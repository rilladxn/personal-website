We collaboratively developed a multiple linear regression model to assess the impact of five key variables on life expectancy across 193 countries, using data from the WHO and United Nations (2000-2015).\nMy contributions included transforming key predictors like GDP and HIV rates to enhance model accuracy, as well as leading the diagnostic testing phase to refine our approach. Together, we interpreted the results, which showed that higher government health expenditure and BMI are positively correlated with longer life expectancy, while higher HIV death rates are linked to shorter life expectancy. Our collective efforts provided important insights into global health outcomes and informed recommendations for improving population health.\n\n\nthe slide deck"

    "text": "2024\n\nAbout\nOur team developed a predictive model for NBA game outcomes using historical game statistics. Our goal was to predict game results by engineering new features, such as home court advantage and win streaks, which could significantly influence a team’s performance. We employed a variety of models, including logistic regression, KNN, random forest, and XGBoost, to optimize predictions. My role involved leading the feature engineering process and fine-tuning the models to improve their accuracy. After evaluating different models, we found that the ensemble method, along with XGBoost, yielded the best performance, with an impressive 80% accuracy on testing data. This project showcased how combining historical data and advanced machine learning techniques can provide valuable insights for predicting sports outcomes and optimizing team strategies.\n\n\nThe Report"

    "text": "2025\n\nAbout\nMy team and I explored factors influencing academic performance by analyzing a dataset of 6,607 students. The study aimed to identify key predictors of students’ success, such as attendance, hours studied, tutoring sessions, access to resources, and demographic influences. We used exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to clean and preprocess the data, followed by logistic regression modeling to predict whether students’ final exam scores would fall above or below the median. Additionally, we applied K-fold cross-validation to ensure model robustness and checked for multicollinearity among predictors. This project provided valuable insights into the relationship between student behaviors, available resources, and demographic factors in shaping academic outcomes.\n\n\nThe Report"
