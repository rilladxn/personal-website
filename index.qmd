Priscilla is a fourth-year student studying Statistics and Data Science at the University of California, Los Angeles. When she\’s not diving into data storytelling, she\’s usually whipping up some matcha or exploring local cafes in search of the perfect cup.

If you\’re interested in discussing anything from data trends to how matcha might just be the perfect data point, feel free to reach out. I\’m always excited to connect with like-minded individuals or explore new opportunities!
